Description:
  A management and navigation client-server web application which utilizes ftp for file operations
  
How to use:
  While there is more in depth description of how to use this application in the documentation we do not currently
  advise you use this application because the security defects have not been thoroughly examined.
  
  Basicly, If one hosts the client side javascript and html, and has the php functions correctly positioned 
  on their server this application SHOULD work, but you should probably just wait till we update it more.
